# Contributing to bemdoc-gen
Hi, thanks for your interest! Here are some ways you can support this project:

## 1 Report bugs
Chances are I already know about the problem but didn't write it down yet. Nevertheless, even in that case, writing down details would really help me. Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/goldst/bemdoc-gen/issues) and after making sure that issue doesn't already exist, use the issue template for bug reports.

## 2 Suggest features
I'm not sure yet if and how I'm going to continue this project, so any suggestions are appreciated! It's the same progress as with the bugs, have a look if this feature request exists in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/goldst/bemdoc-gen/issues) and then create an issue using the feature request template.

## 3 Contribute code
Here, too, it is probably best if you start in an issue. The issues are currently the only communication platform. If there is a thing you'd like to do, leave a note there so we can coordinate what exactly needs to be done. I might ask you to make a pull request. There, please link the issue. Please don't be mad at me if I say no: sometimes, people just have contradicting ideas. You can always do whatever you want on your own fork; I promise I won't be mad at you :blush:

...and most importantly, in any case, don't forget to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)!

Thanks again,

Leonard Goldstein (𝕝𝕖𝕠𝕟𝕒𝕣𝕕-𝕘𝕠𝕝𝕕𝕤𝕥𝕖𝕚𝕟@𝕠𝕦𝕥𝕝𝕠𝕠𝕜.𝕕𝕖)
